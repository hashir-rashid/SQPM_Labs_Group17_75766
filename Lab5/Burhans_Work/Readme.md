# Lab 5: Data Quality and Validation

## Overview
This lab focuses on assessing and improving data quality using two industry-standard frameworks:
1. **Great Expectations**: For data validation and maintaining data integrity in pipelines.
2. **Cleanlab**: For detecting label noise and identifying statistical anomalies/outliers.

## Repository Structure
- `Great_Expectations_Task.ipynb`: Validation of the `Labels.csv` dataset (Timestamps, Elevation, and Completeness).
- `CleanLab_Task2.ipynb`: Identification of label noise in the Iris dataset using Random Forest.
- `CleanLab_Task3.ipynb`: Anomaly detection to identify statistical outliers in the Iris dataset.

## Key Findings
- **Data Validation**: Confirmed that the sensor data adheres to physical bounds (e.g., car elevation remains consistent).
- **Label Issues**: Successfully recovered intentionally introduced label errors where features (Petal Length) contradicted the assigned species.
- **Outliers**: Identified Index 90 as a statistical anomaly due to unusually thin petal measurements for its species.
